**Cursor IDE - Score: 48**
- Data Storage & Security: 15/25
  - Geographic: 3 (Cursor's infrastructure is primarily hosted on AWS with most servers in the US, and some in Tokyo and London - no data residency outside secure jurisdictions)
  - Encryption: 4 (Privacy mode users have data encrypted with client-generated keys for file caching, but code data is visible in server memory during request processing and transmitted unencrypted to multiple third-party AI providers for inference - not true end-to-end encryption)
  - Retention: 8 (Code data exists in memory for request duration plus "minutes to hours" for background jobs and temporary caching - while not permanently stored, this extended memory retention creates compliance risks for sensitive data)
- Training Usage: 8/25
  - Training: 5 (With Privacy Mode enabled, code is never stored or used for training by Cursor or any third-party AI providers - Privacy mode is available to all users and forcibly enabled for team members with automatic enforcement via parallel infrastructure to prevent accidental exposure)
  - Sharing: 3 (Zero data retention agreements with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex, xAI, and Fireworks - however code data is still transmitted to multiple AI providers even in privacy mode for inference processing)

  - Admin: 3 (Privacy mode is automatically enforced for team members with server-side validation every 5 minutes - team-level privacy overrides individual settings)
  - Audit: 7 (Still limited audit capabilities for individual users - basic usage tracking but no comprehensive enterprise audit logs)
  - Integration: 2 (Decent enterprise features available with VS Code extension compatibility)
- Compliance: 12/20
  - Violations: 12 (CRITICAL HIPAA/PII LIMITATION: While SOC 2 Type II certified with annual penetration testing, Cursor explicitly warns users in "highly sensitive environments" to "be careful when using Cursor (or any other AI tool)" - NO HIPAA BAA available, code containing PII/PHI transmitted to multiple third-party AI providers even in privacy mode for inference processing, extended memory retention during background jobs creates compliance gaps, making it unsuitable for healthcare organizations handling protected health information despite privacy mode guarantees for general development)
  - Transparency: 0 (Excellent transparency in their security documentation with detailed subprocessor list and data flow explanations)
- Vendor Transparency: 1/10 (Comprehensive security documentation at trust.cursor.com and cursor.com/security, but security posture depends on underlying AI providers - transparent about current limitations and ongoing security improvements)


**Maestro Labs TeamsMaestro Notetaker Enterprise - Score: 38**
- Data Storage & Security: 12/25

  - Retention: 7 (SIGNIFICANT CONCERN: Microsoft certification shows data retained "More than 90days" after account termination, but enterprise clients can request "0 days data retention" as confirmed in homepage - custom enterprise retention policies available but default retention exceeds standard enterprise expectations)
- Training Usage: 8/25
  - Training: 5 (ENTERPRISE IMPROVEMENT: While privacy policy mentions third-party AI sharing, enterprise tier offers enhanced controls and custom data processing agreements - Microsoft certification shows data sharing agreements in place with third parties, suggesting negotiated training restrictions for enterprise customers)
  - Sharing: 3 (Microsoft certification confirms data transfer to third parties with data sharing agreements in place, but enterprise customers get enhanced control over data sharing arrangements)
- Access Controls: 12/20
  - Admin: 6 (Enterprise tier offers "advanced security, customization and support" suggesting enhanced admin controls beyond basic Teams integration, though specific enterprise admin features not detailed in public documentation)
  - Audit: 3 (Microsoft certification shows comprehensive security monitoring including "event logging set up on all system components" and "logs reviewed on regular cadence" - enterprise customers likely get enhanced audit capabilities)
  - Integration: 3 (Native Microsoft Teams integration with Microsoft Graph API access for calendar functions, enterprise SSO capabilities through Microsoft identity platform integration)
- Compliance: 6/20
  - Violations: 1 (MAJOR IMPROVEMENT: SOC 2 Type 2 certified as of December 2024, GDPR compliant with appointed DPO, comprehensive security controls including penetration testing, disaster recovery, and vulnerability management - however Microsoft certification shows HIPAA as "N/A" indicating no HIPAA compliance even for enterprise)
  - Transparency: 5 (Microsoft certification reveals some implementation gaps - data retention "More than 90days" conflicts with enterprise "0 days" claim, third-party sharing details limited)
- Vendor Transparency: 0/10 (Microsoft app certification provides comprehensive transparency with detailed security questionnaire responses, SOC 2 Type 2 certification, established security processes including incident response, change management, and vulnerability management - significantly better transparency than initially assessed)
