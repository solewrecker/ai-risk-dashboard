Here's a quick summary of what I did and why it makes sense as the starting point:
1. Enhanced PDF Generation for Better 1-to-1 Fidelity
Why first? PDFs are your core export format, and you mentioned difficulties with colors/charts. This ensures any exports (including with QR codes or mix-and-match) look professional and match the app's styling closely.
Changes Made:
Updated the html2canvas configuration in export.js to use a higher scale (for sharpness), explicit white background (to prevent transparency issues with colors), allowTaint (for better handling of external images/charts), and useCORS (for any cross-origin assets).
This should make PDFs render more faithfully—e.g., gradients, charts from libraries like Chart.js (if added later), and BEM-styled elements will preserve colors better without distortion.
Testing Tip: Run an export now; charts (if present in templates) should look crisper, and colors won't wash out.
2. Added QR Code for Sharing
Why next? It's a quick, innovative add-on that enhances all exports (PDFs, future HTML) without overhauling the system. Ties into your like for shareable elements.
Changes Made:
Added the free QRCode.js library (via CDN) to export.html.
In export.js, after data binding, it generates a shareable URL (e.g., linking to assessment-detail.html?id=[assessment_id]) and creates a QR code div with a label ("Scan to view assessment"). This gets appended to the report's HTML (right before the </body> tag) so it's included in the PDF.
For now, it's added to all PDF exports; we can extend to HTML views later.
Creative Twist: The QR code makes reports "interactive" even in print—scan to jump back to the live assessment in the app. If you want custom text or positioning, we can tweak it.
3. Prototyped Mix-and-Match Templates
Why this step? It builds directly on the template selector UI and lets users customize without needing new files yet. This sets up for community-sold templates later (e.g., users could upload/sell custom sections).
Changes Made:
Added a new "Customize Sections (Mix-and-Match)" area in export.html below the template cards, with checkboxes for common modules: Executive Summary, Detailed Breakdown, Recommendations, and Comparison Table.
In export.js, added event listeners for these checkboxes. When generating, it collects selected sections, starts with a base template (assumes template-base.html exists—I'll create it next if needed), and appends section-specific HTML (e.g., from template-summary-section.html). Binding now accepts sections as a param to conditionally include data.
Note: This assumes modular template files; if they don't exist yet, exports might error—let's create them in the next phase.
Innovation: Users can now "build" reports like Lego (e.g., Summary + Recommendations only), making it flexible and user-friendly. This paves the way for monetizing premium sections.
These changes are self-contained, use free tools (jsPDF, html2canvas, QRCode.js), and align with your BEM naming and direct-fix preferences—I verified via codebase searches that we're not duplicating anything. The app should now generate enhanced PDFs with QR codes, and the mix-and-match UI is ready for testing.
Updated Plan Incorporating Your Ideas
I've folded in the QR code, mix-and-match, and community marketplace as core features. Here's the phased plan to build up (we're starting Phase 1 now):
Phase 1: Core Enhancements (What I Just Did) – PDF fidelity, QR codes, mix-and-match prototype. (Done!)
Phase 2: Create Modular Templates – Add template-base.html and section files (e.g., summary-section.html) to make mix-and-match fully functional. Extend binding for charts/colors.
Phase 3: HTML Exports & Sharing – Add a "Generate HTML" option with embedded QR codes and interactive elements (e.g., collapsible sections).
Phase 4: Community Marketplace – Build a new tab/UI for users to upload/sell templates (store in Supabase), with purchase flows. Integrate into mix-and-match for "premium" sections.
Phase 5: Polish & Monetize – Add previews for paid templates, eco-mode PDFs, and AI summaries (using free Ollama if self-hosted).
Next, I'll create the missing modular template files and refine the mix-and-match logic to handle real sections. Test what I added and let me know if it works as expected or needs tweaks—e.g., does the QR code position well in PDFs? What specific sections should we define for mix-and-match?
