# AI Theme Creation Guide

## Your Task
Your goal is to create a new CSS theme for our application dashboard. You will do this by filling in the style rules in the provided `THEME_TEMPLATE.css` file.

## Key Files
1.  **`dashboard.html`**: Use this file as a **read-only reference** to understand the structure and the available CSS classes. **DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE.**
2.  **`THEME_TEMPLATE.css`**: This is the **only file you should edit**. Fill in the empty CSS rules to create the new visual theme.

## Instructions
1.  **Start with the Basics**: Begin by defining a new color palette in the `:root` section of `THEME_TEMPLATE.css`.
2.  **Style Components**: Use the selectors already provided in the template to style each component of the dashboard.
3.  **Maintain Structure**: The layout and dimensions of the components should remain the same. Your focus is on colors, fonts, borders, and backgrounds.
4.  **Ensure Readability**: Pay close attention to color contrast to make sure the text is always easy to read.
5.  **Deliverable**: Your final output should be the single, completed `[NewThemeName].css` file.
