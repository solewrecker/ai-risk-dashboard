# Supabase Data Pathing for Report Generation

This document outlines the preferred data mapping from the Supabase 'assessments' table to the report generation templates.

## General Principle:
- Prioritize top-level properties for general information.
- Use the `assessment_data` JSONB field for detailed, nested information like scores, justifications, and recommendations.

## Field Mapping:

### Top-Level Properties to Use:
- `name`: The name of the AI tool (e.g., "ChatGPT").
- `vendor`: The vendor of the tool (e.g., "OpenAI").
- `risk_level`: The overall risk level (e.g., "high").
- `total_score`: The final calculated score.
- `data_storage_score`: The score for data storage.
- `training_usage_score`: The score for training usage.
- `access_controls_score`: The score for access controls.
- `compliance_score`: The score for compliance.
- `vendor_transparency_score`: The score for vendor transparency.
- `category`: The category of the tool.
- `data_classification`: The data classification.
- `is_public`: Indicates if the assessment is public.
- `primary_use_case`: The primary use case of the tool.
- `assessed_by`: The entity that performed the assessment.
- `documentation_tier`: The documentation tier of the assessment.
- `assessment_notes`: Any additional notes for the assessment.

### Properties to use from `assessment_data`:
- `license_type`: The license type (e.g., "Free").
- `summary_and_recommendation`: The overall summary and recommendation text.
- `compliance_summary`: The summary text for compliance.
- `final_risk_category`: The final risk category.
- `final_score_with_multiplier`: The final score with multiplier.
- `use_case_multiplier_applied`: The use case multiplier applied.
- `confidence`: The confidence score.
- `recommendations`: The list of recommendations.
- `compliance_certifications`: The structured compliance data.
- `sources`: List of sources used for the assessment.
- `azure_permissions`: The azure permissions.
- `detailed_assessment`: Contains the breakdown of scores by category.

## Implementation in `report-preview.js`:

The `prepareTemplateData` function should be updated to reflect this mapping. Instead of relying almost entirely on `primaryAssessment.assessment_data`, it should be structured to pull from both the top-level `primaryAssessment` object and the nested `assessment_data` where appropriate.
