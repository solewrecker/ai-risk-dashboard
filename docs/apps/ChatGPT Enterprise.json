While specific data residency controls are not explicitly documented in available materials, the enterprise service operates within OpenAI's established security framework. The service appears to use standard cloud infrastructure in secure jurisdictions, but lacks detailed geographic control documentation that would warrant a lower score."

SOC 2 compliance confirms industry-standard encryption practices. While customer-managed encryption keys are not mentioned, the published encryption specifications and third-party validation provide strong assurance of comprehensive encryption implementation."

While files are reportedly retained for 3 hours after conversation pause, the broader conversation retention policy lacks detailed documentation. The absence of clear, specific retention timelines and deletion procedures in publicly available enterprise documentation warrants a penalty score reflecting uncertainty about data persistence."

This is a fundamental differentiator from the consumer versions of ChatGPT and represents the strongest possible protection against training data usage. The enterprise service explicitly prohibits the use of customer conversations and data for model improvement, providing legal and technical safeguards against unauthorized training use."

The enterprise service model is designed to maintain data isolation and prevent external sharing, unlike consumer services that may have broader data sharing arrangements. This represents optimal data sharing practices for enterprise customers."

While the service offers activity tracking and basic reporting through the admin interface, the specific details of comprehensive audit logging, real-time activity monitoring, and exportable compliance reports are not fully detailed in available documentation. The existing capabilities appear robust but lack detailed specification of advanced audit features."

The service shows strong commitment to regulatory compliance with documented certifications and security controls. However, specific certifications for specialized regulatory requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS) are not explicitly documented in available materials, and comprehensive compliance documentation is not fully accessible.

However, comprehensive security whitepapers, detailed incident response procedures, and regular transparency reports are not readily available in public documentation. Support responsiveness information is not documented in accessible materials. This represents adequate but not comprehensive vendor transparency, with key enterprise documentation requiring direct vendor engagement."
