Privacy policy mentions 'reasonable physical, technical, organizational and electronic safeguards' without specifying encryption algorithms, key management procedures, or technical implementation details. While security certifications suggest proper encryption implementation, the absence of published encryption specifications and technical whitepapers prevents verification of customer-controlled encryption capabilities."

            "justification": "Privacy policy states data is retained 'for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, or for as long as we are required to do so by law' - this represents standard legal language but lacks specific time limits. The policy mentions deletion upon request with reasonable timelines, suggesting some customer control over retention. While not optimal, this represents limited retention with some deletion procedures available rather than indefinite retention without recourse. The lack of specific retention periods and automatic deletion procedures prevents a lower score."

While the policy mentions sharing with 'vendors and service providers' for service delivery, there are no specific statements about machine learning model development using customer data. The absence of clear training policies creates uncertainty rather than confirmed training use. The policy does not indicate default training use or difficult opt-out procedures, but the lack of explicit guarantees against training use represents a policy gap that creates moderate risk rather than high risk."

Meeting records and sharing activities appear to be logged and accessible to users, providing basic audit trail functionality.

SSO capabilities are indicated through third-party login options mentioned in privacy policy (Google, Microsoft, SSO). The platform's core functionality requires calendar integration, suggesting enterprise-grade connectivity.
