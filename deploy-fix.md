# Fix for GitHub Pages Class Redeclaration Error

## Problem
The `SyntaxError: redeclaration of class s` error occurs because GitHub Pages was serving an unbundled version of `report-preview.html` that had module loading conflicts.

## Solution
The issue has been resolved by:

1. **Built the bundled version**: The `npm run build` command creates a properly bundled `dist/report-preview.html` that eliminates class redeclaration issues.

2. **GitHub Pages deployment**: The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is correctly configured to:
   - Build the project using `npm run build`
   - Deploy the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages
   - Include the bundled `report-preview.html`

## Next Steps
To deploy the fix to GitHub Pages:

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve class redeclaration error in report-preview.html

- Built bundled version of report-preview.html
- Removed DOMContentLoaded listener causing double initialization
- Updated Supabase configuration
- Fixed module loading conflicts"

# Push to main branch (triggers GitHub Actions deployment)
git push origin main
```

## What was fixed:
- ✅ Removed duplicate `DOMContentLoaded` listener from `ReportPreview.js`
- ✅ Updated Supabase configuration in `report-preview.html`
- ✅ Built proper bundled version that eliminates module conflicts
- ✅ GitHub Actions will deploy the `dist` folder with the fixed version

## Verification
After pushing, wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Actions to complete, then check:

The class redeclaration error should be resolved.
