AI Design Model Prompt for AI Risk Assessment Report - Themed Layouts
Context:
You have been provided with a JavaScript file named export-design-data.js. This file contains a single JavaScript object, mockAssessmentData, which represents a comprehensive AI Risk Assessment report. This data is designed to populate HTML templates for exporting assessment results.
Objective:
Your task is to generate multiple distinct design options (HTML, CSS, and optionally, relevant JavaScript for interactivity like collapsible sections) based on the mockAssessmentData provided. The goal is to create design components or full page layouts that effectively display this assessment data in various exportable formats, showcasing different thematic and layout approaches.
Key Requirements:
Data Interpretation:
The mockAssessmentData object's structure directly reflects the data available for an assessment report.
Pay close attention to the comments within export-design-data.js (e.g., // Maps to {{toolName}}). These comments explicitly link data fields to their intended HTML placeholders in the existing template structure (e.g., template-base.html, template-summary-section.html, etc.).
Assume that the data in mockAssessmentData will be used to dynamically populate corresponding HTML elements.
Design Principles:
BEM Naming Convention: ALL CSS class names and any new structural HTML elements you suggest MUST strictly follow the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention. Refer to the existing BEM patterns in docs/css/pages/export-page.css and docs/css/style.css for consistency.
Modularity: Design components that are modular and reusable. Each major section of the report (Executive Summary, Detailed Breakdown, Recommendations, Comparison Table) should be treated as a distinct block with its own styling.
Aesthetics: Aim for professional, clean, and easy-to-read designs. Utilize clear typography, appropriate spacing, and a visually appealing layout. Incorporate subtle visual cues for risk levels (e.g., color-coding for "LOW RISK," "MEDIUM RISK," "HIGH RISK," "CRITICAL RISK").
Responsiveness: Consider how the report will render on various screen sizes (for web viewing) and for print. Incorporate print-friendly styles where appropriate.
Theming and Layout Variations:
Generate diverse design outputs. Avoid creating variations that look too similar.
Explore different themes:
Corporate/Formal: Clean lines, muted color palette (e.g., blues, grays), professional typography.
Minimalist: Focus on white space, simple typography, subtle accents.
Dark Mode: A design optimized for a dark background, ensuring readability and visual comfort.
Vibrant/Modern: Uses a more dynamic color palette, possibly with gradients or more illustrative elements.
Infographic Style: Emphasize visual data representation (e.g., charts, progress bars, custom icons for scores/risks).
Experiment with different layout approaches:
Card-based layout: Each section or data point presented in distinct cards.
Tabular layout: Extensive use of tables for comparisons and detailed breakdowns.
Sectioned/Block layout: Clear, distinct sections separated by generous white space or dividers.
Dashboard-like layout: Incorporating summary statistics and key highlights in a visually accessible way at the top.
Content Sections (based on mockAssessmentData):
Executive Summary: Display high-level information like toolName, vendor, total_score, risk_level, summary_and_recommendation, keyStrengths (derived from recommendations with category 'strength'), and areasForImprovement (derived from recommendations for other categories).
Detailed Breakdown: Visualize the detailedAssessment.assessment_details section, iterating through categories like data_storage_and_security, training_data_usage, access_controls, compliance_and_legal_risk, and vendor_transparency. For each category, display its category_score and summary_and_recommendation/description. Consider making these sections collapsible.
Recommendations: Present the recommendations array, including title, description, priority (high, medium, low), and category.
Compliance Certifications: Design a way to display the compliance_certifications object. This is a dictionary where each key (e.g., "HIPAA", "GDPR") has a status, details, evidence, limitations, and last\verified.
Other Fields: Incorporate primary_use_case, data_classification, assessed_by, confidence, documentation_tier, assessment_notes, azure_permissions (if needed), and sources effectively.
Output:
For each distinct design option, provide the full HTML structure for the report sections.
Provide the corresponding CSS, adhering to BEM, either as inline styles within the HTML or as a separate CSS block.
If interactivity is included (e.g., collapsible sections), provide the necessary JavaScript.
Clearly label each design option (e.g., "Design Option 1: Corporate Theme," "Design Option 2: Minimalist Layout").
