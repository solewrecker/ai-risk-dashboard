The tool automatically captures and processes meeting audio recordings and transcripts, shares data with third-party AI models, lacks enterprise admin controls, has no published security certifications, and stores data in the US with unclear retention policies. The high risk score of 73 combined with the collection of sensitive meeting data makes this unsuitable for enterprise use without significant controls. RECOMMENDATION: BLOCK for enterprise use. Consider enterprise alternatives with proper admin controls and certifications.",
