While some sources indicate prompts are discarded once suggestions are returned, there is uncertainty about retention periods for enterprise telemetry, usage data, and code snippets. The recent changelog about 90-day retention for activity data suggests some retention occurs, but comprehensive retention policies specific to enterprise customers are not transparently published.

While individual subscribers can opt-out of sharing prompts for model training, it's unclear whether enterprise customers have similar protections or if customer code is automatically excluded from training. The distinction between individual, business, and enterprise tiers regarding training data usage is not explicitly clarified in accessible documentation. Without clear contractual guarantees that enterprise customer code is not used for training, this receives a high-risk score reflecting default training use with difficult or unclear opt-out procedures."
