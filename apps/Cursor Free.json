This creates external server dependencies with unclear location controls for sensitive data processing. The multi-provider architecture introduces geographic control risks for organizations with strict data residency requirements, particularly for healthcare or financial data."

However, the multi-provider inference architecture means sensitive code data is transmitted across multiple third-party systems (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI) with varying encryption standards. While transit encryption exists, the complexity of the multi-provider pipeline introduces encryption gaps and inconsistencies in encryption specifications across the inference chain."

The vendor explicitly warns against use in 'highly sensitive environments' indicating inherent retention risks. Multi-provider processing creates retention complexities and potential compliance gaps, particularly problematic for PII/PHI data that may be embedded in code. Extended retention during inference processing contradicts zero-retention claims."

When Privacy Mode is enabled, the vendor contractually guarantees that no code data is used for training. However, Privacy Mode is not enabled by default for free users (though it is enforced for business plans). The opt-out process is straightforward and can be configured during onboarding or through settings. The documentation clearly explains the training implications of each mode."

While team functionality exists for business plans with centralized privacy mode enforcement, the free tier lacks comprehensive enterprise admin dashboards, user provisioning/deprovisioning, and role-based permissions. Business plans offer some organizational visibility and privacy mode enforcement, but free users operate primarily with individual accounts. The documentation indicates that full enterprise controls are available in paid tiers but not in the free version."

The documentation mentions that logs are available but doesn't provide comprehensive details about audit log accessibility for free tier users. Activity tracking is primarily focused on usage statistics rather than detailed user action tracking. Export capabilities appear limited compared to enterprise-grade audit systems. Real-time activity logs and comprehensive compliance reporting are not clearly documented for the free tier."

The documentation mentions WorkOS for authentication handling, suggesting some SSO capability, but comprehensive SAML/OIDC SSO, SCIM provisioning, and Active Directory integration appear to be limited or unavailable for free users. API access for enterprise management is not clearly documented for the free tier. Full enterprise integration features appear to be reserved for paid business plans."

NO HIPAA BAA available, making it non-compliant for healthcare organizations. Code containing PII/PHI is transmitted to multiple third-party AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI) even in privacy mode for inference processing, creating regulatory violation risks.

The vendor acknowledges that requests 'may be sent to OpenAI even if you have an Anthropic model selected' and similar cross-provider routing occurs, making it difficult to track exactly where sensitive data is processed. The opaque nature of inference routing and extended memory retention during background jobs reduces processing transparency, particularly problematic for compliance requirements."

The vendor maintains responsive support channels (security@cursor.com) and commits to acknowledging vulnerability reports within 5 business days.
