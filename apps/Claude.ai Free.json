While Anthropic demonstrates strong commitments to privacy and training data practices, the free tier lacks enterprise-grade administrative controls and audit capabilities essential for business use. The service encrypts data in transit and at rest, does not use customer data for training by default, and maintains transparent privacy policies. However, the absence of centralized admin management, audit logs, and enterprise integrations creates significant governance gaps. Recommendation: Restrict to non-sensitive, individual use cases only. Upgrade to Claude for Work (Team/Enterprise) for any business-critical applications requiring administrative oversight.",
