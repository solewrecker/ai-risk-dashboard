            "score": 6,
            "justification": "Documentation mentions data is encrypted and stored securely but does not specify geographic locations, data residency controls, or jurisdiction details. The privacy policy lacks specific information about server locations or data processing regions. Given the absence of clear geographic control documentation, this scores as 'External servers, unclear location' which represents a moderate risk for enterprise data governance requirements."
          },
          "encryption_standards": {
            "score": 4,
            "justification": "Read.ai states that 'every measured meeting is encrypted with permissions' and mentions SOC 2 Type 2 certification, indicating some encryption standards. However, the documentation does not specify encryption algorithms (AES-256), key management practices, or detailed encryption specifications. Without published encryption specifications or technical details about encryption at rest and in transit, this falls into the 'Basic Encryption' category with TLS encryption in transit and standard encryption at rest but limited technical details."
          },
          "data_retention": {
            "score": 9,
            "justification": "Documentation is extremely unclear on data retention policies. While the privacy policy mentions users can delete reports and account data, there is no specific retention period documented (e.g., 90 days, 1 year). The policy mentions 'Post-call Read settings allows for audio, video, data, report, and even account deletion' but does not specify automatic deletion timelines or default retention periods. Without clear retention schedules or automatic deletion procedures, this approaches the maximum penalty score for unclear retention policies."

          "model_training": {
            "score": 15,
            "justification": "The privacy policy states 'Contributing to our model is completely optional, and opt-out by default' which suggests that by default, user data is NOT used for training. However, the documentation is somewhat ambiguous about enterprise controls and whether this opt-out applies universally across all enterprise accounts. Given that the tool explicitly mentions model contribution as 'optional' and 'opt-out by default,' this suggests there IS potential training use with an opt-out mechanism available, but the process and enterprise-wide controls are not clearly documented. This falls between 'Opt-out available with clear process' and 'Default training use with difficult opt-out' - scoring conservatively at 15 points due to unclear enterprise-wide opt-out procedures."
          },
          "data_sharing": {
            "score": 0,
            "justification": "The privacy policy explicitly states 'we don't sell your data to anyone - period' and 'Your data is kept private and only used to provide the service to you.' This indicates no third-party data sharing for commercial purposes. The documentation clearly states data is not sold and is kept private, which aligns with 'No third-party sharing' criteria."

            "score": 6,
            "justification": "Documentation mentions 'Robust settings give you full control over access to metrics at the individual and organizational level' and references enterprise features, but does not provide specific details about centralized admin dashboards, user provisioning/deprovisioning capabilities, or role-based permissions. The privacy policy mentions workspace settings but lacks detail about enterprise admin controls. Without clear documentation of admin dashboard capabilities, user management features, or organizational controls, this falls into 'Limited Controls' category with some user visibility but minimal centralized management capabilities clearly documented."
          },
          "audit_capabilities": {
            "score": 7,
            "justification": "No specific mention of audit logs, activity tracking, or exportable reports is found in the available documentation. While the tool mentions SOC 2 Type 2 certification (which typically requires audit capabilities), the customer-facing documentation does not describe audit log access, user activity tracking, or compliance reporting features available to enterprise administrators. Documentation not available for audit capabilities, resulting in maximum penalty score for this criterion."
          },
          "integration": {
            "score": 2,
            "justification": "Documentation clearly states support for SSO integration: 'Creating an account with Read is a multi-step process that requires the user to either login with SSO (e.g. Microsoft, Google)' and mentions integration with calendar systems and video conferencing platforms (Zoom, Microsoft, Google). The tool appears to offer basic SSO support with user sync capabilities through calendar integration, but detailed enterprise integration features like SCIM provisioning or advanced API access are not documented. This aligns with 'Basic SSO Support' with SSO available and basic user sync capabilities."

            "score": 6,
            "justification": "Read.ai mentions SOC 2 Type 2 certification and offers Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) for HIPAA compliance, stating 'Read is a popular choice for health and human services teams that require the confidentiality of protected health information.' However, the documentation lacks details about other compliance certifications (ISO 27001, GDPR Article 28 compliance specifics) and does not provide easily accessible compliance documentation. The mention of SOC 2 and HIPAA BAA availability indicates partial compliance capabilities, but without comprehensive compliance documentation readily available, this falls into 'Partially Compliant' category with some compliance measures but gaps in comprehensive regulatory compliance verification."

          "data_processing_transparency": {
            "score": 6,
            "justification": "Documentation is vague about specific data processing locations, detailed retention schedules, and comprehensive third-party processor relationships. While the privacy policy mentions data encryption and user control over sharing, it lacks data flow diagrams, specific processing locations, or detailed third-party processor lists. The processing description is general rather than specific, indicating opaque data processing practices without comprehensive transparency documentation."

            "justification": "While Read.ai provides basic privacy policy and terms of service, the documentation lacks comprehensive security whitepapers, detailed incident response procedures, or regular transparency reports. The privacy policy directs users to contact support for additional documentation ('Please contact support@read.ai to verify your Workspace settings and permissions and receive the required documentation'), indicating that key security documentation is not publicly available. Support responsiveness and comprehensive documentation availability are unclear, as detailed security information requires contacting support rather than being readily accessible. This represents minimal transparency with basic policy documentation only."
