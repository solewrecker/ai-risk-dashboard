# AI Risk Pro: Generous Freemium Strategy
## "Build for Free, Scale with Pro" Model

### 🎯 Core Philosophy: Value-First, Not Paywall-First

- Give users substantial free value to build real solutions
- Create genuine dependency through usefulness, not artificial limitations
- Only charge when users are genuinely getting business value
- Make the upgrade feel like a natural progression, not a hostage situation
